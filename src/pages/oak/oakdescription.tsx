      <h1>The Oak</h1>
      <p>
        By the river that flows through the valley, a sizable clearing can be
        seen. High foliage surrounds it, standing tall enough that most would be
        unseen if stood amongst it. In the very center of the clearing, a great
        oak tree stands firm and proud. The large branches of the aged tree
        separate in a peculiar way compared to many other trees. Each branch
        stretches out away from the tree, some slightly higher or lower than the
        others. The way the tree has grown, it looks almost akin to a cradle or
        nest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up the dark gray-blue bark of the tree, several engravings can be seen,
        particularly on the eastern side of it. Covering the branches are
        slender leaves, a dark gray-green in color with a purple outline. Though
        a more unusual sight for a tree is the myriad of silver trinkets,
        baubles, and ornaments that hang from them. Most of which are necklaces,
        chimes, and large broken pieces of sculptures, though all Night Elven in
        origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one were to stand on the eastern side of the central oak during the
        night, they would no doubt see the Moon setting on the opposite side of
        the tree. However, for a moment, it would seem as if the Moon itself was
        nestling into the tree top.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the clearing that surrounds the great oak. A fully grown gray treant
        can often be seen. Whether tending to the oak tree itself, placing up
        more adornments, or even tending to the several treant sproutlings, of
        varying color, that can be found dotted around the area.
      </p>
      <h1>The Valley</h1>
      <p>
        The Moonrise River runs lazily through the valley and ends as a
        tributary to the Iris River. Three bridges cross it, one out of stone
        and two others held up by trees and timber provided by the wisps. These
        lead a path past the different locations, mostly formed by foot traffic
        and later reinforced with tiling. Scattered throughout the valley there
        are small houses of the more permanent inhabitants that do not reside at
        the commons or the temple. These houses vary in shape, size and state of
        repair depending on who, if any, lives there. A few of the houses are
        built on the foundations of older buildings that once belonged to the
        Hermitage but that have been demolished in ages past when age caught up
        with them.

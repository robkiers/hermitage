        A temple sits near a number of waterfalls. It is a modest temple sat at
        an idyllic part of the valley near the waterfalls and rivers. Walkways
        span over the streams and a tower rises up near the cliff side. This
        tower holds a library with texts on Elune and their prayers. Recently a
        bridge has been grown up to the upper ledge nearby. In the back there is
        a small entrance into the cliffs, that through a number of caverns and
        tunnels leads to the commons below.

        A larger house nearby is the house of the Moonspeaker. It holds the
        personal rooms of the leading priestess of the Moonrise Hermitage as
        well as space for a number of novices and servants dedicated to her. It
        currently sits empty.
      </p>

        An observatory stands on the cliffs above the temple, its glass roof
        allowing direct vision of the stars. Patterns engraved in the glass help
        discern what is and what will be. Along the ground floor there are star
        maps and tomes of knowledge on the constellations and the lore of the
        zodiacs.

      <h1>The Temple</h1>
      <p>
        The temple of the Moonrise Hermitage sits close to the top of the same hill that the commons is constructed
        against. It is a smaller temple near a number of waterfalls, flanked by two smaller towers and one larger one
        that reaches up to the cliff side besides it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The usual approach from the commons leads you to a fork in the road. One path leads to the Moonspeaker's mansion,
        a little further up and the other leads to a set of stairs. Following the stairs up you come to the circular
        dome that is the temple proper. Inside a small stream flows through it that leads to one of the aforementioned
        waterfalls. An elevated platform gives space for the Sisterhood to perform their sermons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three doors lead to the adjacent building that the Sisterhood use in their nightly business. It is half open to
        the elements outside with a secondary platform that holds a few smaller rooms. This building is set up between
        the walkways towards the two smaller towers. The northern tower is the inner sanctum of the Sisterhood, where
        they perform their sacred rituals to Elune that only the Priestesses are privy to. The other tower stands on a
        lone outjutting of rock, reachable by a bridge that spans the small crevice with the path leading to the
        Moonspeaker's mansion. This tower is generally off-limit as well, to those whom are not part of the Moonrise
        Hermitage.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the circular temple, one can also go through an open door towards the large tower. The different floors are
        also used by the Sisterhood, some as residence and others as library. A statue of Haidene adorns it side, her
        gaze set towards the skies. A tree grows around this tower to form a newly made bridge that goes towards the
        cliff side and towards a path further up the mountain to an observatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        An observatory stands on the cliffs above the temple, its glass roof allowing direct vision of the stars.
        Patterns engraved in the glass help discern what is and what will be. Along the ground floor there are star maps
        and tomes of knowledge on the constellations and the lore of the zodiacs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally there is a small area behind the temple, where a path leads to the tunnels that connect to the commons
        further down below. A different path leads to the large house of the Moonspeaker. It holds the personal rooms of
        the leading priestess of the Moonrise Hermitage as well as space for a number of novices and servants dedicated
        to her. It currently sits empty.

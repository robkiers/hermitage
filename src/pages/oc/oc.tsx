          The Moonrise Hermitage focuses more on the civilian part of Kaldorei life. But even though we are not
          military, we cab still stand our ground. We are guided by the Sisterhood, but many are ‘normal’ members of
          Kaldorei society. Many teachers guide the young in the ways of the hunt, nature and Elune. We provide support
          to the Sentinels as they ride to battle, either with additional blades or by providing healing.
        </p>

          Our home is in Ashenvale from where we reach out towards the rest of Kalimdor and beyond. We actively help
          roleplayers creating their own stories and events, to see them grow and evolve through roleplay.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect our members to be mature, well mannered, well read on relevant lore, and open to ideas and
          suggestions. We strife to work closely with other Kalimdor guilds both ICly and OOCly. In former times we were
          part of the Kalimdor Project before this went dormant.

          The Moonrise Hermitage rejects only heretics and the most unrepentant criminals. The Deathknights and Illidari
          that have returned have no place either in a community of villagers and militia.

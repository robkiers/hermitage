        <h1>Out of character</h1>
        <p>
          The Moonrise Hermitage focuses more on the civilian part of Kaldorei life. But even though we are not
          military, we can still stand our ground. We are guided by the Sisterhood, but many are ‘normal’ members of
          Kaldorei society. Many teachers guide the young in the ways of the hunt, nature and Elune. We provide support
          to the Sentinels as they ride to battle, either with additional blades or by providing healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our home is in Ashenvale from where we reach out towards the rest of Kalimdor and beyond. We actively help
          roleplayers creating their own stories and events, to see them grow and evolve through roleplay. We expect our
          members to be mature, well mannered, well read on relevant lore, and open to ideas and suggestions. We strife
          to work closely with other Kalimdor guilds both ICly and OOCly.
        </p>
        <h1>Recruitment</h1>
        <p>
          The Moonrise Hermitage rejects only heretics and the most unrepentant criminals. The Deathknights and Illidari
          that have returned have no place in a community of villagers and militia, nor do practitioners of dark magics.
          <br />
          In a great change for the Hermitage, arcanists have recently been accepted, provided they respect Kaldorei
          traditions and show restraint in their practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Moonrise Hermitage does not have a formal application method. As a small tight-knit community, we prefer
          forge meaningful connections with those interested in joining the guild. We can be found in Astranaar or
          Ashenvale all year round, with the few exceptions of occasional travel and events. We are open to newcomers as
          well as more experimented roleplayers. All new guildmembers will be welcomed as Honored Guest, with no
          guarantee to become Grove Dweller or Grove Protector. Progression in the guild is left at the discretion of
          the Hermitage Council.
        </p>
        <h1>Activity</h1>
        <p>
          The Moonrise Hermitage is an 'evening guild'. Our usual time of activity spawns from 20.00 RT to midnight. We
          are dedicated to more casual and spontaneous roleplay, as well as a focus on organizing and participating in
          community initiatives. We do not require the attendance from our members, we aim to keep a lively guild with a
          focus on quality over quantity. We do have occasional campaigns, where the focus will be on the militia, but
          this is left to the discretion of the DM.

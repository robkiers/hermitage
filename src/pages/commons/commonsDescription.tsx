      <h1>The Commons</h1>
      <p>
        A tree rises up besides a cliff edge, a tower entwined in it. A branch from that tree has been woven into a
        bridge that leads to a walkway that runs along the cliff. This promenade is roofed over and has several sections
        sealed with divider screens making for smaller rooms fit for crafts and personal areas. The commons is split in
        two parts, as time and water caused a chasm to form between the two sides of the commons. A large tree grows in
        that chasm and supports the bridges leading over it, being part of the promenade that goes all along the edge of
        the mountainside. An elevator is suspended from the tree, used to hoist up goods and people.

        When you enter the Silvershine Tower there is a board that notifies the people of the current chores and tasks
        of the Hermitage, as well as proclamations. It doubles as a makeshift armory for the few protectors that the
        Hermitage currently has. A floor up there is a spot for prayer and healing, for those that rapidly need it
        before being brought to a place that is more suited for a longer stay. The tower holds several offices that are
        meant for administrative purposes, with books and lists of the Hermitage resources.
      </p>

        When you leave the Silvershine Tower and cross the bridge to the hermitage proper you come to a hollowed out
        nook in the mountainside, which makes for a large central teras. A petrified tree holds up the rocky roof above.
        Several structures are set into the cliff side, housing the workshops of the Hermitage. A new smithy sports
        excellent equipment, made by the dwarves of Morodnir. A small basin of water sits in its back, where water flows
        through to be used by the artisans.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the left hand side there is a large herb garden on several levels with a little stream falling down said
        levels. They are meticulously maintained and grow a large variety of herbs to be used in alchemy and food
        preparation, even some plants that are not native to these lands. The large structure in the back holds the
        common rooms, such as a kitchen and meeting space for the Hermitage. There are places to meet and plan, to
        teach, to read and to rest. In typical Kaldorei fashion these rooms are separated by dividers, leaving a fairly
        open floor plan that can be adjusted as needed.

        When you enter through one of its doors, the central hall sports a kitchen and bar at the far end. A staircase
        leads up to the second floor. Central to this room is the tree that supports the roof above. From it hangs a
        carving: The presented imagery depicts eight of the great Ancients. Ursol and Ursoc, brothers, stand strong and
        proud. Aviava, wings spread with purest grace. Cenarius, Lord of Groves stands with his gnarled paw to the
        heavens. His father, Malorne matches him - antlers raised. Ashamane, the ferocious, bears her teeth. She is
        matched by the snarl of Goldrinn beside her. Finally Aessina - the Mother Wisp, floats ever watchful. The
        carving is crowned by a large, dominant center-piece: a crescent moon - that blankets the display with abstract
        rays of moonlight. Carved upon the back, it reads: "Designed by Tessaemay Lunarowl-Manapearl. Carved by Telathas
        Moonrage.‚Äù
